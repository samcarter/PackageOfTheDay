# Package of the day

As the [ducks of the year](https://github.com/samcarter/ducksoftheyear) soon celebrate their first birtday, it is time for a new project. The idea is to post each day a LaTeX package which I did not know before or which deserves a bit more attention. 

- the package (or class/Ti*k*Z library/...) should be publically acessible, best if it is on CTAN
- I don't gurantee that all the packages in this list are good or even work. Maybe I just like the idea or topic, so use them on your own risk
- participation is very welcome! If you have any packages which you would to see in this list, open an issue or make a pull request
